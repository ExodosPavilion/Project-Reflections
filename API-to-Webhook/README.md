# API-to-Webhook

A way to get API data and send it to a webhook

For this project I will use the mangadex api.

My goals for this project will be:

-   Use the MangaDex API to get relevant data
-   Create and maintain a form of database that will keep track of the latest updates
    -   Might find a new way to do this or will just go with JSON
-   Send data to the webhook

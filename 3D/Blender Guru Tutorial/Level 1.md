The main screen is known as the __3d viewport__

## Moving objects
You can move objects around in blender using the __move__ tool located in left of the 3d viewport
![[move.png]]

When the tool is selected you will notice that the object has some colored arrows coming out of it like so:
![[move_arrows.png | 250]]

Clicking and holding the arrow allows you to move the object in that axis direction

Alternatively you can also use the middle mouse button to make the object snap onto the axis the cursor is closer to

> The shortcut for this action is __G__ (G for grab)

> The shortcut to select the desired axis and move it in that direction is done by tapping one of these keys:
	>> x -> x axis
	>> y -> y axis
	>> z -> z axis

## Rotating objects
You can rotate an object in the 3d viewport by selecting this tool found right under the move tool on the left:
![[rotate.png]]

When the tool is selected you will notice colored circles around the object. (like so:)
![[rotate_arrows.png | 250]]

Clicking and holding the circles will allow you rotate the object in that desired direction

You could use the middle mouse button as you did with the move tool, however it seems a wonky to use.

> The shortcut for this action is __R__ (R for rotate)

> The shortcut to select the desired axis and rotate it in that direction is done by tapping one of these keys:
	>> x -> x axis
	>> y -> y axis
	>> z -> z axis

## Scaling objects
You can scale an object in the 3d viewport by selecting the tool found right under the rotate tool on the left:
![[scale.png]]

When the tool is selected you will notice colored lines around the object. (like so:)
![[scale_arrows.png | 250]]

Clicking and holding the lines will allow you to scale the object in that desired direction

You could use the middle mouse button as you did with the move and rotate tool, however it seems a bit inconvenient to use.

> The shortcut for this action is __S__ (S for scale)

> The shortcut to select the desired axis and scale it in that direction is done by tapping one of these keys:
	>> x -> x axis
	>> y -> y axis
	>> z -> z axis

## Transforming objects
There is a transform tool available for use in the toolbar on the left, right under the scale tool
![[transform.png]]

When the tool is selected you will notice colored lines around the object. (like so:)
![[transform_arrows.png | 250]]

As you can see it is a mash up of all three of the aforementioned tools in the same object. It is not really continent to use.


## Traversing the Viewport
On the top right hand corner of the viewport you can find some icons that look like this:
![[transversing.png]]

The xyz axis is something you can click and move the cursor around to orbit around the center of your view

The selecting and holding the magnifying glass you can zoom in or out of the center of your viewport

The clicking and holding the hand icon and moving the cursor will pan the view

Alternatively
> You can use the __middle mouse button__ to orbit around the center of your view

> You can use the __scroll wheel __ to zoom in or out

> SImilarly you can use __Shift + middle mouse button__ to pan the view

Sometimes you want the view to snap onto a selected object.

> You can do this by selecting the object you want to see and pressing the __numpad .__ (numpad period key)


## Deleting an Object
You can delete objects by right clicking the object and selecting delete.

> Or you can use the delete shortcut which is __x__ which will ask for confirmation or the __Delete key__ which won't prompt you


## Adding a new object

You can add a new object to the scene by going to the top of the viewport and clicking on add followed by the object you wish to add

> You can also use the shortcut __Shift + A__ to add a new object

## Search
> You can press __F3__ to bring up search function in blender where you can look up things

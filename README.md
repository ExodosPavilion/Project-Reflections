# Project Reflections

This repository contains my reflections on the various publically available Projects / repositories that I have personally made


I use the following git log format to get the desired output for the commit logs found in the coding project reflections

```git
git log --pretty="#### %H%nAuthor: %an <%ae>%n%<(2)Date:% %cD%n%<(3)%n%s%n"
```
